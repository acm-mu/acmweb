        <h3>Problem Description</h3>
        <p>Ryan is thinking about putting together an art exhibit featuring brick walls. He is concerned about the success
            of this business venture, since there isn't a lot of variety implied in a brick wall art exhibit.</p>
        <p>Ryan wants to know the number of ways bricks can be arranged to build a particular size wall.</p>
        <p>When building a brick wall, it is beneficial to the strength of the wall to ensure that the cracks between bricks
            never line-up in consecutive layers, i.e. never forming a “running crack”. (Not to mention, Ryan thinks that
            running cracks make a brick wall look ugly)</p>
        <p>For example, the following 9x3 wall is not acceptable due to the running crack between the ends of the top and
            middle rows:</p>
        <img src="q8.png">
        <p>Given the full dimensions (width and height) of a wall, <b>write a program which counts the number of ways of
                building the wall from 2x1 and 3x1 bricks, ensuring that there are no running cracks.</b></p>
        <p>Bricks are laid horizontally; 2x1 bricks and 3x1 bricks take up 2 or 3 units of a single row of the wall.</p>

        <h2>Writing Your Solution</h2>
        <p>Enter your solution in the body of this method in the given code skeleton:</p>

        <h3>Method Signature</h3>
        <pre class="prettyprint">public static int countBuildConfigurations(int wallWidth, int wallHeight)</pre>

        <h3>Sample Method Calls</h3>
        <p><code>countBuildConfigurations(9, 3)</code> returns <code>8</code></p>

    <h2>Testing Your Program from the Console</h2>
    <h3>Console Input Format (line by line)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><code>n</code>, the number of tests</li>
        <li>for each test, a single line containing the width and height of the wall, separated by spaces</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Assumptions</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 &le; <code>n</code> &le; 10</li>
        <li>1 &le; <code>width</code> &le; 30</li>
        <li>1 &le; <code>height</code> &le; 12</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Console Output Format</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>for each test, a single line with the number of ways to build the wall according to the conditions</li>
    </ul>
