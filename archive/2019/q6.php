        <p>Clyle was able to replicate the stats for the Dunedin Highlanders and was offered a job after he graduates from
            Marquette University. The Four Amigos are now on their way from Auckland, New Zealand to Beijing, China.</p>

        <p>They decide to visit an old archeological dig site. Jimothy read in his magazine, <em>Old Math, Old Dudes, New
                Concepts</em>, about a Chinese book called the <em>I Ching</em>.</p>

        <p>The <em>I Ching</em>, also called <em>The Book of Changes</em> is an ancient Chinese manuscript about philosophy,
            religion, literature, and art. While digging at the site, The Four Amigos discover what they believe to be a
            rough draft of <em>The Book of Changes</em>. Jimothy can't believe his eyes, and he tells one of the site
            managers, Cassley. </p>

        <h3>Problem Description</h3>

        <p>Cassley now needs The Four Amigos help for her research. Famously, <em>The Book of Changes</em> makes use of a
            base-64 numbering system. Cassley believes the rough draft, however, uses a base-62 numbering system. She has
            devised a way to compare similarities between the number bases, but they need a way to generate the data to make
            those comparisons quickly.</p>

        <p>To help Cassley and solve this problem, <strong>write a program that will take an integer in decimal (base-10), a
                lower bound, and an upper bound and lists the decimal number in every base between (and including) the
                bounds.</strong></p>

        <p>The program should implement base conversion manually, rather than simply calling native methods for base
            conversion such as Java's <code>Integer.toString(int x, int radix)</code>.</p>

        <p>The possible digits for higher bases start with the numerical digits (0-9), then the capital letters (A-Z), then
            the lowercase letters (a-z). For example, base 40 may make use of the digits:
            <code>0,1,2,...,8,9,A,B,C,...,Y,Z,a,b,c,d</code>.</p>

        <h3>Method Signature</h3>

        <h4>Java</h4>
        <pre class="prettyprint">public static String[] multBaseConverter(int base10, int lwrBnd, int uprBnd)</pre>

        <h4>Python</h4>
        <pre class="prettyprint">def multBaseConverter(base10, lwrBnd, uprBnd):</pre>

        <h3>Sample Method Calls</h3>

        <h4>Java</h4>
        <p><code>multBaseConverter(10, 2, 4)</code>
            returns a <code>String</code> array containing the value <code>10</code> in bases 2, 3, and 4:
            <code>{"1010", "101", "22"}</code></p>

        <h4>Python</h4>
        <p><code>multBaseConverter(10, 2, 4)</code>
            returns a list containing the value <code>10</code> in bases 2, 3, and 4: <code>["1010", "101", "22"]</code></p>
    </div>
    <h2>Testing Your Program from the Console</h2>

    <h3>Console Input Format</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>the first line contains <code>t</code>, the number of test cases</li>
        <li>for each test case, a single line contains the following three integer inputs, space-separated:
            <ul>
                <li><code>base10</code>, the number in decimal (base 10)</li>
                <li><code>lwrBnd</code>, the lowest base to which <code>base10</code> should be converted</li>
                <li><code>uprBnd</code>, the highest base to which <code>base10</code> should be converted</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Assumptions</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>0 &le; <code>t</code> &le; 10</li>
        <li>2 &le; <code>lwrBnd</code> &le; 62</li>
        <li>2 &le; <code>uprBnd</code> &le; 62</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Console Output Format</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>for each test, a single line with the output numbers, comma-separated and in brackets (e.g., print "[1010, 101,
            22]")</li>
    </ul>
    <div>
        <h3>Sample Runs</h3>

        <h4>Input:</h4>
        <pre>
2
10 2 4
100 15 20
        </pre>

        <h4>Output:</h4>
        <pre>
[1010, 101, 22]
[6A, 64, 5F, 5A, 55, 50]
        </pre>

        <h3>Sample Run Explanation</h3>
        <p>There are two tests in the sample run (<code>t</code> = 2).</p>

        <p>The first test formats the value <code>10</code> in bases 2, 3, and 4. The second test formats the value
            <code>100</code> in bases 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20.</p>
