        <p>Lemme was able to get his computer back and book a luxurious AirCnC in the heart of New Delhi. They enjoyed their
            stay and have now landed in Auckland, New Zealand.</p>

        <p>Clyle is a big rugby fan and one day wants to be sports statistician for his favorite team, the Dunedin
            Highlanders. He is super excited as he has tickets to watch them play while he is in New Zealand.</p>

        <h3>Problem Description</h3>

        <p>Clyle has extraordinary luck (he won the lottery as proof) and has now won another raffle. This time, it's to be
            the Highlanders official team statistician for one game. He cannot believe it and is so excited he doesn't sleep
            the night before the game.</p>

        <p>Clyle ends up falling asleep during the game and canâ€™t recall what happened. He says that if he was given
            possibilities of the scoring summary, how the team finished with the <code>total</code> score, he could remember
            more about the game. After every game, the scores are listed in the local newspaper. The ways to score in rugby
            are as follows:</p>

        <table>
            <tr>
                <td><b>Way To Score</b></td>
                <td><b>Points</b></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Try (T)</td>
                <td>4</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Goal Kick (GK)</td>
                <td>2</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Penalty (P)</td>
                <td>2</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Drop Goal (DG)</td>
                <td>1</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <p>There is no limit on the number of times a team can score in any one way.</p>

        <p>To solve this problem, <strong>write a program which takes the final team score as an integer and returns the
                number of combinations of scores that would result in that final team score.</strong></p>

        <p>For example, there are exactly 3 ways to score 3 points:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>a drop goal, and a penalty</li>
            <li>a drop goal, and a goal kick</li>
            <li>three drop goals</li>
        </ul>
