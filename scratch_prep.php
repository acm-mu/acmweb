        <h2>Competition Structure:</h2>
        <p>
            There are five problems to solve. Scoring details are as follows:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Three <b>Technical Problems</b> have 5 possible points each to earn, totaling 15 points for the technical
                section.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Points are awarded for how many of the problem requirements were fulfilled, and how well they were
                    fulfilled. Partial credit will be awarded.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Two Creative Problems have a possible 15 points each to earn, but the creative section is capped at 20 total
                points.</li>
            <ul>

                <li>On one hand, you could balance your effort between the two problems to try to earn 10 points on each.
                    Alternatively, you could go all-out on one problem to earn 15 points, and only need to earn 5 points on
                    the other to get maximum credit.</li>

                <li>For this section, in addition to submitting your Scratch project file, you will need to submit a short
                    “design document” (.txt file from Notepad or Notepad++) listing the features you created for your
                    project. Since the creative section is very open-ended, this design document lets you “sell” your
                    solution to the judges. These problems can take a lot of work, so brag about your favorite features of
                    your solution - make sure none of them are overlooked!</li>

                <li>Points are awarded for how well the solution fits the problem’s prompt, and the quantity and quality of
                    the features included (and listed in the design document).</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <h2>Competition Rules:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>You will have three hours to work on 5 questions.</li>

            <li>You will receive templates for some of the questions.</li>

            <li>Try to score as many points as possible. You don’t have to attempt every problem.</li>

            <li>Submit your solution as soon as it is ready - don’t wait to submit all your solutions at the end.
            </li>

            <li>Judges will give feedback on your solutions throughout the competition.</li>

            <li>There is not a penalty for re-submitting to a problem. You can improve your solution according to
                judge feedback and re-submit to earn more points.</li>

            <li>Do not submit the same solution twice. <b>Only re-submit to a problem if you have changed your
                    solution.</b></li>

            <li>You may use outside sources (your internet, image editing tools, etc.) to create sprites, sounds,
                and other materials for your project.</li>

            <li>You may not take code from public projects on the scratch website, or projects you have worked on
                outside of the competition.</li>

            <li>You may not collaborate with other teams; sharing materials or discussing the problems with other
                teams is prohibited.</li>

            <li>You must ask for permission before using electronic storage or communication devices (phones, flash
                drives, etc.), or any communication or storage software (email, google drive, etc.).</li>

            <li>If you are unsure if a specific outside source is permitted, ask a room proctor! Room proctors may
                also request you to stop using a specific website or device if they suspect it is being used to
                break the rules of the competition.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
